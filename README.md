# AWS Cloud Certified Professional Udemy Notes

These notes are jotted down while I am studying for AWS CCP exam. I take them while taking the lessons from [St√©phane Maarek](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-new/) on Udemy and do not substitute the course in any way. The grammar may be poor due to limited time and to keep the information as condensed as possible.
