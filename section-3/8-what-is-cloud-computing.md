## What is Cloud computing?

- on demand delivery of resources
- pay as you go
- provision the right size and type
- access them instantly as you want them
- UI based access

### New way for IT
- Use cloud instead of data center
- some example: gmail, dropbox, netflix (entirely on aws)

### Deployment models of the cloud
- Private: Single organization, private, ex: rackspace. secure
- Public: AWS, Azure, GCP. resources are owned by the providers and delivered to the uses over the internet.
- Hybrid: Mix of both. Keep some on premise and extend some on the cloud.

### 5 characteristics of the cloud:
- on demand
- broad network access
- multi tenancy and resource pooling: others can share the infra w/o comprimising the security
- elastic and scalable
- Measured service and pay as per use

### 6 Advantages:
- Trade Capital Expense (CAPEX) for operational expense (OPEX)
    - on demand, dont own hardware
    - reduced total cost of ownership and opex
- Benefit from the massive economies of scale
  - reduced prices
- Stop guessing capacity
  - scale automatically based on the usage
- Increase speed and agility
- Go Global in minutes

### Problems Solved
- Flexible
- Cost Effective
- Scalable
- Elastic
- High Available
- Agile
